What's this? Why you've found my technology reading list! 
I'm naturally curious about how things work and I do a lot of reading as a graduate student. This year I'd like to track and share some of my readings.
General themes around my reading list will continue to be around <strong> AI, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction and Security </strong>.

<ul>
    {% for row in site.data.reading %}
      <li>
         <a href="{{row.url}}">{{ row.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
